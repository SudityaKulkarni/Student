Quantum mechanics arose to explain phenomena like the behavior of electrons and photons. It introduces the concept that energy is not continuous but comes in discrete packets called quanta. This means that energy can only exist in specific, defined amounts. Quantum mechanics uses mathematical models to predict the probability of finding a particle in a certain state or location.",

This means that energy, like electricity, comes in discrete packets, not in a continuous flow. These packets of energy are called quanta. Light, for example, is composed of tiny packets of energy called photons. Each photon has a specific amount of energy determined by its frequency. Higher frequency light (like blue light) has photons with more energy than lower frequency light (like red light). This explains the photoelectric effect, where light can knock electrons off a metal surface only if the photons have enough energy.",

Imagine a coin spinning in the air. Before it lands, it's neither heads nor tails; it's in a superposition of both states.

If you measure a property of one entangled particle, you instantly know the corresponding property of the other particle, even if they are light-years away. This instantaneous correlation doesn't mean information is being transmitted faster than light (which would violate Einstein's theory of relativity); it's more about the particles sharing a single quantum state.",
